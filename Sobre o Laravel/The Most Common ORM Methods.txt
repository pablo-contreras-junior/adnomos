Here are the most common ORM methods to deal with entities and their relationships:

	1. Finding records:
	   - User::find(id); -> returns an User instance equivalent to the given id number.
	   - User::findOrFail(id); -> throws an exception if it wasn't founded.


	2. Finding all the records:
	   - User::all(); -> returns a collection with all the records in the table.


	3. Fetching with condition:
	   - User::where('name','pablo')->first(); -> returns only one record that matches the condition.
	   - User::where('name','pablo')->get(); -> returns a collection of records that fits with the condition.
	   We can also use:
	   - User::where('age','>=',18)->get();


	4. Filtering with performance:
	   - User::whereIn('name',['Pedro','JoÃ£o','Carlos'])->get();
	   - User::whereNotIn('age',[16,17,18]);


	5. Creating new records:
	   - $user = new User();
	     $user->name = "Pablo";
	     $user->age = 19;
	     $user->email = "pabloguajardojr4@gmail.com"
	     $user->save(); // update the database

	   Or we can create (most commonly used) mass assignment:
	    - User::create([
		'name'  => 'pablo',
		'age'   =>  19,
		'email' =>  'pabloguajardojr4@gmail.com',
	    ]);


	6. Updating data:
	   - $user = User::find(id);
	     $user->name = "pablo";
	     $user->save();

	   We can also do this:
	   - User::where('id',10)->update(['name'=>'mario']); //in this case, we don't need to use save().


	7. Deleting records:
	   - $user = User::find(1);
	     $user->delete();

	   Or deleting directly:
	   - User::where('id','12')->delete();

	   Or deleting all the records instead of only an instance:
	   - User::truncate();
